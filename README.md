# VBA-Challenge
This challenge is to create a script that loops through all the stocks for one year and outputs the following information:

  * The ticker symbol.

  * Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

  * The total stock volume of the stock.

The script must also use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.
Note that the Script needs to make sure that any % are formatted correctly.

As a bonus, the script should include a table which outlines the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume".
